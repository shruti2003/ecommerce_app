Task Overview
Develop a RESTful API for an e-commerce platform with the following:

User Authentication

    Register/Login (JWT-based)

    Role-based access (Admin, Customer)

Product Management

    CRUD for products (Only admins can add/remove products)

    Products have: name, price, description, stock

Order Management

    Customers can place orders

    Orders have: items, total_price, status (pending, shipped, delivered)

    Admins can update order status

Tech Stack
    You can pick based on what you're comfortable with, but a solid choice:

    Backend: Python (FastAPI/Flask), Node.js (Express/NestJS), Go (Gin/Fiber)

    Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL (or MongoDB if NoSQL is preferred)

    Authentication: JWT-based auth

    Tooling: Postman or Curl for testing

Interview Structure
    ðŸ’¡ They will test how you structure your code, handle edge cases, and explain your decisions.

    Set Up the Project (~10 mins)

    Initialize the project (npm init, pip install fastapi, etc.)

    Set up a minimal folder structure


Implement User Authentication (JWT) (~15â€“20 mins)

    POST /register â†’ Create user

    POST /login â†’ Authenticate user & return JWT


Middleware for protecting routes (admin, customer)

Build Product API (~15 mins)

    POST /products â†’ Admins add new products

    GET /products â†’ List all products

    PUT /products/{id} â†’ Update product details

    DELETE /products/{id} â†’ Remove a product (admin-only)


Build Order API (~20â€“25 mins)

    POST /orders â†’ Customer places an order

    GET /orders/{id} â†’ Fetch order details

    PUT /orders/{id} â†’ Admin updates order status


Error Handling & Optimization (~10 mins)

    Handle bad requests, authentication failures, missing products

    Use pagination for product listing (?page=1&size=10)

    Use caching (optional, but shows system design thinking)
